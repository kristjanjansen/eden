# The Eden project

## 1. Flower

ðŸ’» Source: [/flower](/flower)

ðŸš€ Demo: https://flower.kristjanjansen.now.sh

A dashbord prototype, implemented in `create-react-app --typescript`.

Here is a quick code walkthrough:

### App.tsx

[/flower/src/App.tsx](/flower/src/App.tsx)

Project main entrypoint uses `react-router` to set up three main routes.

The router is wrapped into custom `UIProvider` (located in `./contexts/ui.js`) to provide a global state handling.

### OverviewRoute.tsx (WIP)

[/flower/src/routes/OverviewRoute.tsx](/flower/src/routes/OverviewRoute.tsx)

A project overview route.

It is a live playground of CSS grid layout that provides a glimpse of what the latest browser features can offer in terms of layout flexibility and confirm that **there is no need for a third-party grid framework such as `flexgrid`**.

The cards on the page are randomly generated placeholders, generated in `./src/data/overview.js`

The slider controls on a page allow changing numbers and columns. The feature is implemented with a `<Slider>` component and `useState` hooks that pass the current `cols` and `rows` values to CSS grid parameters.

### GraphRoute.tsx

[/flower/src/routes/GraphRoute.tsx](/flower/src/routes/GraphRoute.tsx)

_The_ view of the project. There is a lot of happening here:

1.  A fake graph data with edges and nodes are generated in `./src/data/graph.ts`.

2.  Graph data is passed to `elkjs` graph layout generator that interprets the input data and returns an enriched data with edge and node coordinates and the width and height of the graph layout.

    More about https://github.com/OpenKieler/elkjs

    Live demo of graph generation: https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/elk

3.  The enriched graph data is passed to `<GraphLayoutHtml>` component that interprets the data and renders out a hybrid layout using SVG and HTML.

4.  In `<GraphLayoutHtml>`, edges of the graph are rendered as SVG lines: the the path coordinates of each edge are passed to the `generateLine()` function (found in `./src/utils.js`) that is based on `d3.line()` SVG path generator.

    Line coordinates are going through an additional `d3.curveCardinal()` smoothening function with a `tension` parameter that adjusts the lines to be less "boxy".

    See more about d3 line functions here https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#lines

    > There is an alternative `GraphLayoutSVG` component that shows a raw rendering of the graph data.

5.  Nodes of the graph are rendered as HTML boxes by `<GraphCard />` and are overlayed on top of SVG, using CSS relative positioning.

6.  `<GraphCard />` displays node data. Node status is passed on to `<StatusIcon />` component.

7.  `<StatusIcon />` has different presets for status display. By default statuses are displayed as UTF8 circles, except `status = "processing"` that is rendered by `<StatusSpinner>` component.

8.  `<StatusSpinner>` is using https://github.com/sindresorhus/cli-spinners library and animates the CLI text-based spinners in HTML.

    It uses the CLI spinner source files to get the animation frames (UTF8 characters / emojis) and the delay between the frames.

    For animation, `useInterval` hook is used (based on [Dan Abramov article](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/)) that cycles thought the animation frames and displays the text-based spinner.

### LogRoute.tsx

[/flower/src/routes/LogRoute.tsx](/flower/src/routes/LogRoute.tsx)

Realtime log output simulation view.

1. A fake log data is generated in `/flower/src/data/logs.js`. It contains various structured log data (timestamp, message, etc) and also a random `duration` value in milliseconds.

2. `<LogRoute>` component maps the log data to **array of promises** and resolves them serially using the `duration` value and passes log items to the `<Log>` component. This allows log display to feel more "real-life-like" where each new log item arrives in varying time offset.

3. `<Log>` component sets up a scrolling HTML div container and uses a combination of React `useRef()`, `useEffect()` and JS DOM `scrollIntoView()` functions to automatically scroll the div container to the lastmost line of the log. Each log line is rendered using `<LogLine>` component.

4. `<LogLine>` is displaying a log item, splitting it into columns, applying different visual importance for each column.

## 2. Soil

ðŸ’» Source: [/soil](/soil)

Soil is a CLI application prototype, implemented in Typescript and Ink library https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink.

It includes the "Hello World" command made with React components and also a set of Mocha / Chai UI tests.

## 3. Trellis

ðŸš€ Demo: https://trellis.kristjanjansen.now.sh/

ðŸ’» Source: [/trellis](/trellis)

A documentation site prototype, implemented in Docz https://github.com/doczjs/docz.

Docz is a documentation generation toolkit based on Gatsby, Gatsby themes, and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown combined with React components).

The prototype includes three colors-related components (Garden colors, Flower prototype colors, and ANSI terminal colors), showing off how components can enrich the documentation experience, link together different UI-related codebases, and codify visual design decisions.

### Prima CLI specs

ðŸš€ Demo https://prisma-specs.netlify.com/cli/init/starter-kit/

The spec uses MDX components that import CLI React components (based on Ink library) that output ANSI terminal text dumps. These CLI components are passed on to into a
[https://github.com/prisma/specs/tree/master/cli](term.js) terminal emulator in the browser to make sure the CLI components work the same way as they do in the real terminal.
